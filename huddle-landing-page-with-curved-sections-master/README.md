## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first project I developed using the mobile-first approach. The site was built using only responsive units and dimensions (with the exception of border-radius, borders, an img margin fix and shadows). Media queries were created to assure the most optimal viewing experience for the user of any device. If this project's aim wasn't to be very simplistic, I see a lot of potential to adjust it even further for larger screens as some sections and elements become huge in higher resolutions.

### Continued development

I'm getting more and more comfortable using Grid and Flexbox. I plan on diving deeper with both techniques, especially to develop a natural feel of when to use which and how I can optimize my code to be as compact and efficient as possible. I know I still have to learn how to group properties and use utility classes.
